Free copyright notice: drafting notes
This is a copyright notice template for a website. Copyright is an important intellectual property right. Although websites themselves don't have copyright protection, the works that make up a website do. This includes website code and written content, photos, illustrations and logos. By using this template, the website operator claims ownership of the website and its content, and sets out how others can use the website. The notice also includes special rules about copyright infringement and related notifications. The template can be used on its own, or as part of a website's terms and conditions of use.
